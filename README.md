### Data Visualization with Python
This project will introduce you to some of the most used plotting libraries in Python.

We will explore the following libraries:
1. **Matplotlib and Seaborn** to produce quality figures (Line, Histo, Bars, Scatter, Buble and Reg plots) 
2. **Waffle chart** which consist of cells to display progress towards a goal or visualize categorical data, 
3. **Wordcloud** for high-level data analysis and visualization of text data 
4. And **Folium** for Geospatial data.
